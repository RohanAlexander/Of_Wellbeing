# Explain how you download the data

The General Social Survey (GSS) is a comprehensive survey conducted in the United States since 1972 to 2012, providing insight into various social and demographic trends and attitudes. Accessing and analyzing the data requires downloading the data package from the GSS website and cleaning and processing the data to select relevant variables for the research question. This may involve dropping irrelevant variables, transforming or recording variables, and creating new variables. Once the data cleaning is complete, the selected variables can be analyzed using statistical software or other analytical tools to explore patterns and relationships. Despite being a valuable source of information, careful attention to data cleaning and analysis is crucial to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings.
